# Welcome to my blog! 

I've finally gotten around to setting this up! YAY! 

I'm going to write about:
* Product management and things I've learnt along the way
* Books I've been reading and the TLDR I gathered to save you the time to read it
* Notes I take when building my analytical thinking and learning new topics
