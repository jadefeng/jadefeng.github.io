Hi there! 

Very excited to have you come across my website! Maintaining a personal blog has been a bucket list item for several years now. The number of times I've written a personal OKR to get this website up and running more times than I'd care to admit. 

So now we're finally here, with a live website built by yours truly!!

## TLDR about me
My favorite life quote is:
> “It's better to regret what you have done than what you haven't.” - Paul Arden

My other favorite life quote is:
> "Never by groceries when you're hungry" - probably my mum

Want to learn a bit more about me? Here's my [LinkedIn][LinkedIn-url] and my [Medium blogs][Medium-url].
