# The Power Of Moments: Why Certain Experiences Have Extraordinary Impact
## by Chip Heath and Dan Heath

## Crystallization of discontent

*   Shame and disgust are powerful motivators “what are we doing - are we even human? Eating each other’s shit.”
*   Crystallization of discontent is a specific moment that sparks a realization that something isn’t okay. 
*   Something that is an engineered moment that can be powerful. 


## Aha moment is created IN the moment 
1. Leader knows what truth they want to share
2. Realization strikes fast (minutes, hours)
3. Audience discovers truth themselves - becomes their own insight 


# “Let them trip over the truth.”
*   Being a salesman vs letting them trickle the truth. Let them understand the problem. 
*   Self insight only comes from stretching yourself - putting yourself out there where you can risk an outcome 


# Positive peaks are more memorable that negative peaks 
*   Mentors create a productive level of stretch 
*   Making yourself vulnerable. Taking a risk - helps you also understand risk about yourself 


## Mentors push. Mentees stretch. 
*   “I’m giving you these comments because I have high expectations and I know you can reach them.” vs. “You should make these changes”. The former is more impactful.
*   This re-wires how people take feedback. It’s a push to stretch. 
*   Tension of mentoring: over and under protecting them 


# Learn to embrace failure. Ask regularly: “What did you fail at this week?”
*   Push to stretch. Make it part of a casual conversation rather than an end. 
*   Willingness to put yourself in a place that you can fail 
*   The goal is LEARNING 

> High expectation + assurance + direction + support = formula for mentorship to help mentees realize insights 

## Moments of pride

*   Pride is when your skills recognized by others
*   Recognition is a very powerful motivator and reward
*   “I saw what you did, and I appreciate it.” Make the recognition public. 

> Learn to use gamification strategies: “level up” strategy to adapt your goals 

<code>
Example: I have a goal to learn how to DJ and mix music.
*   Level 1: follow a YouTube video on DJ skills
*   Level 2: play something that I can upload on Mixcloud 
*   Level 3: play at a friend’s birthday or house party
</code>

> Learn to create moments of pride for everyone

Learn how to proactively create intermediate milestones for yourself and others. Create moments of pride is extremely impactful.

## Managing moments of fear:
*   Your journey goes through Milestones, Peaks, and Transitions. 
*   Successful people have an OBSESSION TO COMPLETION
*   Exposure therapy - managing fear to learn how to act with a moment of courage 
*   Use steps and levels to motivate yourself to push boundaries
*   You need need to practice stressful moments” interactively. Practice your courage to learn how to react. Rehearse what you’ll do and say. 


## Ensure that your environment is set up for success

*   Relentless pressure for results + avert eyes management = cut corners and fraud (e.g. banking scandals)
*   Blurry accountability + get things done urgency = accidents (eg. car accidents)
*   Leader Bias + permissive environment = abuse 

## How to create a moment
*   Break the script (something unexpected)
*   Boost sensory appeal (make it memorable)
*   Raise the stakes (make it matter)

## Creating moments of connection

*   Moments can create shared meaning and bond between people
*   Can’t deliver great customer experience if you don’t have great employee experience
*   Synchronization event must be done together to be powerful and feels real (remote content is okay for a daily review, but needs to be in person for an impactful moment)
*   Perceived pain drives pro-sociality and bids people together 
*   Bond comes from struggle together eg. Fraternity hazing

## Passion vs purpose

*   Passion = enthusiasm (passionate people are still poor performers if they don’t have purpose. Passion is Individualistic - can be isolating) 
*   Purpose = meaning (can be cultivated!!)
*   Purpose is more important than passion. Passion is like fire that can be powerful but misused. 
*   Purposes can bring people together and make them “work through the suffering” and build stronger bonds 

# It is more important to have purpose. Connecting to meaning helps people find their purpose, and strong purpose can make shared meaning 

Ask your customers and stakeholders **what is their purpose**, not just our interpretation of what is right and what we think the solution might be. “What matters to you?”
